The `Embedding_Siyabasa API` provides high-quality text embedding models specifically designed for the Sinhala language. Generate embeddings for Sinhala words, phrases, and sentences using our latest model `UgannA_SiyabasaV2`. These language-specific embeddings power advanced NLP tasks such as semantic search, text classification, and document clustering, delivering more accurate and context-aware results than traditional keyword-based approaches.

**Key features:**
- Language-specific: Optimized exclusively for Sinhala text
- 300-dimensional embeddings: Rich semantic representations
- FastText architecture: Proven performance for morphologically rich languages
