The `Embedding_Siyabasa API` provides high-quality text embedding models specifically designed for the Sinhala language. Generate embeddings for Sinhala words, phrases, and sentences using our latest model `UgannA_SiyabasaV2`. These language-specific embeddings power advanced NLP tasks such as semantic search, text classification, and document clustering, delivering more accurate and context-aware results than traditional keyword-based approaches.

**Key features:**

- Language-specific: Optimized exclusively for Sinhala text
- 300-dimensional embeddings: Rich semantic representations
- FastText architecture: Proven performance for morphologically rich languages

## **What Are Embeddings?**

Text embeddings are numerical representations—or vectors—of words and sentences. They capture the semantic relationships and contextual meaning of language, allowing machines to process and understand text in a way that's similar to human comprehension. Models trained specifically on a single language provide a more nuanced and accurate understanding than broad, multilingual models.

### **Why Specialized Sinhala Embeddings Matter**

While multilingual models exist, they often underperform for languages with unique linguistic characteristics like Sinhala. Our research shows that language-specific embeddings provide significantly better results for:

- **Semantic understanding** of Sinhala's rich morphology
- **Contextual accuracy** in Sinhala sentence structures
- **Domain-specific applications** tailored to Sinhala content
